				<p>
					Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                         princess. But she had an enchantment 
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                         only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                         Many brave knights had attempted to 
                         free her from this dreadful prison, 
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                         the tallest tower for her true love 
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
                         a load of - (toilet flush)
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme1_q2">Question 2</h1>

				<p>
					Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
               		day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
               		after the ogre.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme1_q3">Question 3</h1>

				<p>
					Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
               		men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
               		and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
               		men are in the dark.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme1_q4">Question 4</h1>

				<p>
					There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
               		sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
               		to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
               		are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
              		who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
               		little pigs.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme1_q5">Question 5</h1>

				<p>
					The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
               		of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
               		hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
               		with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme1_q6">Question 6</h1>

				<p>
					Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
               		Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
               		for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He 
               		quickly hides behind Shrek.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme1_q7">Question 7</h1>

				<p>
					He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
               		and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
               		and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
               		begins walking back to his cottage.

			<div class="t2_questions">
				<h1 id="ancre_theme2_q1">Question 1</h1>

				<p>
					Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights 
               		a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a 
               		noise. He stands up with a huff.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme2_q2">Question 2</h1>

				<p>
					There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that 
               		made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns 
               		and spots 3 blind mice on his table.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme2_q3">Question 3</h1>

				<p>
					Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. 
               		The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at 
               		him.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme2_q4">Question 4</h1>

				<p>
					The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his 
               		pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing 
               		flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme2_q5">Question 5</h1>

				<p>
					The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
               		onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
               		table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
               		up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme2_q6">Question 6</h1>

				<p>
					More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. 
               		They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic 
               		Mirror.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme2_q7">Question 7</h1>

				<p>
					Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking 
               		lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.
				</p>

			<div class="t3_questions">
				<h1 id="ancre_theme3_q1">Question 1</h1>

				<p>
					Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box 
               		marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors 
               		open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin 
               		to sing.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme3_q2">Question 2</h1>

				<p>
					He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel 
               		of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the 
               		other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides 
               		past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. 
               		As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger 
               		beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. 
               		Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much 
               		fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice 
               		to say that Shrek kicks butt.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme3_q3">Question 3</h1>

				<p>
					Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field 
               		heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme3_q4">Question 4</h1>

				<p>
					They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through 
               		a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying 
               		to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, 
               		so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme3_q5">Question 5</h1>

				<p>
					They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There 
               		is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where 
               		the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very 
               		foreboding.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme3_q6">Question 6</h1>

				<p>
					Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. 
               		Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon 
               		breathes fire.
				</p>

				<h1 id="ancre_theme3_q7">Question 7</h1>

				<p>
					Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona 
               		so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She 
               		then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off 
               		the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep. 
               		Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for 
               		a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders 
               		and shakes her away.
